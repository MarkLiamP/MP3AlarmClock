# Description
This was the first program I finished back when I was teaching myself to code sometime around 1999 or so.  I thought I had lost the source code about a decade ago until I found it in an old backup this week.   This likely isn't useful to anyone (it's written in C for the Win32 API so...) but I might want to revisit it for nostalgia's sake in another 20 years and I reckon it's safer here than on a 20 year old CD-R.
