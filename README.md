#Description
This was the first program I finished back when I was teaching myself to code sometime around 2004 or so.  I thought I had lost the source code about a decade ago until I found it in an old backup this week.  I've no clue how useful this may or may not be to anyone (it's written in C using the Win32 API so probably not very useful) but I reckon it's safer here than on a 20 year old CD-R.
